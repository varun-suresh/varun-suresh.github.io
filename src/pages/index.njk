    <h1>Hello, I'm Varun</h1>
    <p>

    I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on Computer Vision. I'm interested in self-supervised learning, leveraging unlabeled data to build scalable AI systems. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm currently on a sabbatical. Previously, I worked on the Machine Learning Data Engine team at <a href="https://www.aurora.tech"> Aurora Innovation </a>. I worked on the Auto-Labeler to create accurate 3D point cloud labels and 2D image labels. 
    I worked on the same product in 3 different companies as a result of multiple aquisitions! (Aurora, <a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2020/Aurora-is-acquiring-Ubers-self-driving-unit-Advanced-Technologies-Group-accelerating-development-of-the-Aurora-Driver/default.aspx">Uber ATG </a>, <a href="https://www.mty.ai">Mighty AI</a>). Before that, I worked on face recognition at <a href="https://www.waldo.photos"> Waldo Photos </a>.
   </p>
   <p>
   I got my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Utah. During my Masters program, I worked on building a tool to classify <a href="https://www.inscc.utah.edu/~tgarrett/masc.html">snowflakes </a>with <a href="https://profiles.faculty.utah.edu/u0294462">Prof Tim Garrett </a>.
