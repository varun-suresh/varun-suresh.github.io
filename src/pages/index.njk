    <h1>Hello, I'm Varun</h1>
    <p>
    I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on Computer Vision. My interests lie in self-supervised learning, leveraging unlabeled data to build scalable AI systems. I enjoy tinkering with language models and fine-tuning LLMs.

    I'm currently on a sabbatical. Previously, I worked on the machine learning data engine team at <a href="https://www.aurora.tech"> Aurora Innovation </a>. I worked on the Auto-Labeler to speed up 3D point cloud labeling and 2D image labeling.
