## Introduction

[ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385) is a very popular convolutional neural network architecture introduced in 2015. This paper was one of the first to successfully train extremely deep neural networks. They did it using a residual block, where an identity connection is added after two layers of convolution as shown in Figure 1.

## Code

I implemented ResNet using PyTorch and the training code is [here](https://github.com/varun-suresh/experiments-with-gpt2/blob/main/vision_models/train.py#L6). I chose CIFAR-10 because training can be done on a single 8GB GPU in about 20-30 minutes.

## Results

| Model     | No of Params | Test Error |
| :-------- | -----------: | ---------: |
| ResNet-20 |        0.27M |      8.73% |
| ResNet-56 |        0.85M |      7.13% |
